                You Pay Per Lead. Lead prices and monthly costs vary based on your business type & location. As this is a competitive marketplace, the higher the cost of your type of work, the more expensive a lead will be. For example, a carpet cleaning companyâ€™s average ticket prices is considerably lower than that of a personal injury attorney, thus you can expect the lead cost to be much lower as well.
